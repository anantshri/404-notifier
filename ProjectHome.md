This is a modified version of 404 Notifier plugin by Alex King. @ http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress

The plugin by Alex was with the aim to find out which links we are missing where as this plugin is now modified to show who actually is looking for those links.

and as a surprise after running this plugin on my site for almost a year i found that the most 404 hits are registered by new emerging search engine crawlers trying various combination of keywords.

also i was able to identify some virus attacks that could have been a disaster as they accidentally hit a 404 on my website and i was notified.

so sharing the same code with everyone.

basically this mails you following details
